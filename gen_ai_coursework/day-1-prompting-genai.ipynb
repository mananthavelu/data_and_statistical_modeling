You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompting using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n## New for Gemini 2.0!\n\nThis course material was first launched in November 2024. The AI and LLM space is moving incredibly fast, so we have made some updates to use the latest models and capabilities.\n\n* These codelabs have been updated to use the Gemini 2.0 family of models.\n* The Python SDK has been updated from `google-generativeai` to the new, unified [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai) SDK.\n  * This new SDK works with both the developer Gemini API as well as Google Cloud Vertex AI, and switching is [as simple as changing some fields](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/#:~:text=.Client%28%29-,API%20Selection,-By%20default%2C%20the).\n* New model capabilities have been added to the relevant codelabs, such as \"thinking mode\" in this lab.\n* Day 1 includes a new [Evaluation codelab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output).","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

This involves cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data.\n    *   **Why:**  LLMs learn from the data they're trained on.  Dirty, inconsistent data leads to a poorly performing model.  High-quality data improves generalization and reduces bias.\n    *   **Details:** Common techniques include:\n        *   **Cleaning:** Removing HTML tags, special characters, irrelevant noise (e.g., excessive whitespace).\n        *   **Normalization:** Lowercasing, stemming/lemmatization (reducing words to their root form), handling contractions.\n        *   **Tokenization:** Breaking text into smaller units (words, sub-words) that the model can process.  Popular tokenizers include WordPiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and SentencePiece.\n        *   **Data Deduplication:** Removing near-duplicate texts.\n        *   **Filtering:** Removing texts based on quality measures (e.g. text length, perplexity).\n2.  **Tokenization:**\n    *   **What:** The process of converting text into numerical representations (tokens) that the LLM can understand.\n    *   **Why:** LLMs work with numbers, not raw text.  The choice of tokenization method significantly impacts vocabulary size, training efficiency, and model performance.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   **Word-level tokenization:** Simple but inefficient for large vocabularies.\n        *   **Character-level tokenization:** Handles out-of-vocabulary words well but results in long sequences.\n        *   **Subword tokenization (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece):** A compromise, breaking words into frequently occurring subword units. BPE is an iterative algorithm that merges frequent character or character sequence pairs. WordPiece uses a probability-based approach to select which subwords to merge. SentencePiece can treat the input text directly as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n        *   **Vocabulary size:** Impacts model size and performance.

This involves cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data.\n    *   **Why:**  LLMs learn from the data they're trained on.  Dirty, inconsistent data leads to a poorly performing model.  High-quality data improves generalization and reduces bias.\n    *   **Details:** Common techniques include:\n        *   **Cleaning:** Removing HTML tags, special characters, irrelevant noise (e.g., excessive whitespace).\n        *   **Normalization:** Lowercasing, stemming/lemmatization (reducing words to their root form), handling contractions.\n        *   **Tokenization:** Breaking text into smaller units (words, sub-words) that the model can process.  Popular tokenizers include WordPiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and SentencePiece.\n        *   **Data Deduplication:** Removing near-duplicate texts.\n        *   **Filtering:** Removing texts based on quality measures (e.g. text length, perplexity).\n2.  **Tokenization:**\n    *   **What:** The process of converting text into numerical representations (tokens) that the LLM can understand.\n    *   **Why:** LLMs work with numbers, not raw text.

Here's the previous response again, formatted in Markdown:\n\n**What is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting?**\n\nCoT is a prompting technique that encourages LLMs to break down complex problems into a series of smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of directly asking for the final answer, you guide the model to show its reasoning process. This typically leads to significantly improved accuracy, especially for tasks like:\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Math problems with multiple steps.\n*   **Commonsense Reasoning:** Questions that require real-world knowledge and inference.\n*   **Symbolic Reasoning:** Tasks involving logic, planning, or code.\n\n**How to Implement CoT Prompting:**\n\n1.  **Demonstration (Few-Shot Learning):** This is the most common and effective approach. You provide the LLM with a few example questions *and* their corresponding step-by-step solutions. The LLM then learns to apply a similar reasoning process to your target question. Here's a template:\n\n    ```\n    Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?\n    A: Roger started with 5 balls.\n    He bought 2 * 3 = 6 more balls.\n    Now he has 5 + 6 = 11 balls.\n    So the answer is 11.\n\n    Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make a pie and then bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?\n    A: The cafeteria started with 23 apples.\n    They used 20, so they had 23 - 20 = 3 apples left.\n    Then they bought 6 more, so they have 3 + 6 = 9 apples.\n    So the answer is 9.\n\n    Q: Weng earns $12 an hour. Last week, he worked 7 hours on Monday, 4 hours on Tuesday, 4 hours on Wednesday, 5 hours on Thursday, and 5 hours on Friday. How much did Weng earn last week?\n    A: Weng worked 7 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 25 hours.\n    He earns $12 per hour, so he earned 25 * 12 = $300.\n    So the answer is 300.\n\n    Q: [Your Target Question Here]\n    A:\n    ```\n\n    *   **Key Elements:**\n        *   **Clear Problem Statement:** Present the question concisely.\n        *   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Each line should represent a logical deduction or calculation.\n        *   **\"So the answer is...\"**: Explicitly state the final answer. This helps the LLM learn the desired output format.\n        *   **Variety:** Use a diverse set of examples that cover different aspects of the problem type. Don't just repeat the same logic with different numbers.\n        *   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style and format across all examples.\n\n2.  **Zero-Shot CoT (Using Hints):** You can sometimes encourage CoT reasoning without providing examples by simply adding a phrase to your prompt that hints at the need for step-by-step thinking. However, this is generally less effective than few-shot CoT.\n\n    ```\n    Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? Let's think step by step.\n    A:\n    ```\n\n    Other variations:\n\n    *   \"Let's work this out logically.\"\n    *   \"What are the intermediate steps?\"\n    *   \"Let's reason through this.\"\n\n**Using LLMs to Generate Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**\n\nYes, this is a very useful technique! You can use a powerful LLM to generate the demonstrations (the example question-answer pairs with CoT reasoning) that you'll then use in your own CoT prompting. This is especially helpful if you need a large number of high-quality examples.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1.  **Define the Task and Problem Domain:** Clearly specify the type of problem you want the LLM to generate examples for (e.g., grade-school math word problems, logical puzzles, coding tasks).\n\n2.  **Prompt Engineering for Example Generation:** Design a prompt that tells the LLM *exactly* how to create the examples. Here's a template:\n\n    ```\n    Your task is to generate examples of questions and their solutions, showing the reasoning process step-by-step. Each example should include a question (Q) and an answer (A) with a detailed chain-of-thought explanation.\n\n    Format:\n\n    Q: [Question Text]\n    A: [Step 1: Reasoning step 1]\n       [Step 2: Reasoning step 2]\n       ...\n       [Final Step: Calculation or deduction leading to the final answer]\n       So the answer is [Final Answer].\n\n    Example:\n\n    Q: Sarah has 7 apples. John gives her 3 more. How many apples does Sarah have in total?\n    A: Sarah starts with 7 apples.\n       John gives her 3 more, so we add 3 to 7.\n       7 + 3 = 10\n       So the answer is 10.\n\n    Now generate [Number] more examples of similar questions and their step-by-step solutions:\n    ```\n\n    *   **Key Elements:**\n        *   **Clear Instructions:** Tell the LLM its specific task.\n        *   **Desired Format:** Be very explicit about how the question and answer should be structured.\n        *   **Example (One-Shot):** Providing a single example is often helpful to guide the LLM's style. Make sure your example is high-quality.\n        *   **Number of Examples:** Specify how many examples you want the LLM to generate.\n\n3.  **Refine and Filter the Generated Examples:** LLMs are not perfect. You'll need to carefully review the generated examples and filter out any that:\n\n    *   Contain errors in logic or calculation.\n    *   Lack a clear chain of thought.\n    *   Are poorly worded or ambiguous.\n    *   Are too similar to each other (you want diversity).\n\n4.  **Use the Filtered Examples for CoT Prompting:** Once you have a set of good-quality, LLM-generated examples, you can use them in your few-shot CoT prompts, as described earlier.\n\n**Tips for Better CoT Performance:**\n\n*   **Start with a Strong Model:** More powerful LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM 2, Claude 3) tend to be better at CoT reasoning.\n*   **Temperature Settings:** Experiment with the temperature setting. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.2-0.5) will make the LLM more deterministic and focused. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.7-0.9) can introduce more creativity and exploration, but also more errors. Generally, for CoT, you want a lower temperature to promote accuracy.\n*   **Prompt Engineering is Key:** Spend time refining your prompts. Small changes in wording can have a significant impact on the LLM's performance.\n*   **Test and Evaluate:** Thoroughly test your CoT prompts with a variety of questions and evaluate the accuracy of the answers.\n*   **Consider Fine-Tuning:** For very specific tasks, fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of CoT examples can significantly improve performance. However, this requires more data and resources.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nCoT prompting is a powerful technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs. By providing examples of step-by-step reasoning, you can guide the model to solve complex problems more accurately. You can even leverage LLMs themselves to generate those examples, saving you a lot of time and effort. Remember to carefully review and filter the generated examples to ensure their quality.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.

A name that sounds good in one language might not in the other. Try to say the name out loud.\n*   **Associations:** What does the name *mean* to you, and what kind of feeling does it evoke? Consider local customs as names might mean different thing locally.\n*   **Local History:** Are there local features or historical figures that could inspire names?\n*   **Appropriateness:** Make sure the name isn't offensive, confusing, or overly similar to existing names in the area.\n*   **Street type indicator**: Weg (path/road, suitable for small roads and pedestrian), Strasse (street, main roads) and Gasse (lane, small roads and lanes, sometimes only for pedestrians)\n\nI hope this list is a good starting point!\n -------------------------\nOkay, focusing on street and road names near Dübendorf that evoke a sense of tranquility, nature, and safety, perfect for a family stroll, here's a list with explanations:\n\n**Focusing on Nature & Serenity:**\n\n*   **Waldstrasse (Forest Street):**  This is a classic and suggests proximity to a wooded area. Forests often have quiet paths and provide a sense of calm.  (Search for Waldstrassen in Dübendorf and nearby areas.)\n*   **Seestrasse (Lake Street):**  If near the Greifensee, a \"Seestrasse\" would imply beautiful lakeside views and a relaxed atmosphere. Many lakeshore roads are pedestrian-friendly.  (Search for Seestrassen near Greifensee, like in Maur or Fällanden.)\n*   **Bachweg (Brook Way/Creek Path):** The sound of running water is naturally soothing. A \"Bachweg\" would ideally run alongside a small stream or brook.\n*   **Brunnenweg (Fountain Way):** This implies a peaceful area with the possibility of a charming village fountain as a focal point. Fountains create a gentle, inviting atmosphere.\n*   **Rosenweg (Rose Way):** The association with roses evokes beauty and tranquility. It suggests a well-kept and possibly fragrant environment.\n\n**Focusing on Peacefulness & Community:**\n\n*   **Sonnenweg (Sun Way):** This name implies brightness, positivity, and a welcoming environment. A street with this name is probably open and receives plenty of sunlight.\n*   **Dorfstrasse (Village Street):** Typically found in smaller villages around Dübendorf.  \"Dorfstrasse\" usually denotes a central, community-oriented street with slower traffic.\n*   **Schulweg (School Way):** While busy during school hours, \"Schulweg\" often signifies pedestrian-friendly design to ensure the safety of children. Outside of school hours, they can be very quiet.\n*   **Gartenstrasse (Garden Street):**  Suggests streets lined with gardens, potentially quieter and greener than more commercial areas.\n*   **Ahornweg (Maple Way), Lindenstrasse (Linden Street), Eichenweg (Oak Way):** Streets named after trees evoke nature and stability.  The presence of mature trees adds to a sense of calm.\n\n**Consider these roads, depending on the distance to your family and preferred activity:**\n\n* **The Glatt river banks** Many areas alongside the river Glatt has been restructured in recent years to offer a better pedestrian experience, or a smoother biking journey\n*   **Greifensee shore pathways:** Well structured path system with wonderful sight\n\n**Tips for Finding these Streets & Assessing Suitability:**\n\n1.  **Use Google Maps or a Similar Service:** Search for the street names mentioned above within or near Dübendorf. Use satellite view and street view to get a sense of the street's character.\n\n2.  **Look for Green Spaces:** Parks, green belts, or the edge of the forest are always good indicators of family-friendly walking routes.\n\n3.  **Check for Pedestrian Infrastructure:**  Are there sidewalks, dedicated bike lanes, or pedestrian crossings?\n\n4.  **Consider Traffic Levels:**  Even if a street name is appealing, high traffic can make it less pleasant. Check traffic patterns on Google Maps (if available) during the time of day you plan to walk.\n\n5.  **Read Reviews or Ask Locals:**  If you're planning a visit, search for local forums or groups to ask residents about good walking areas for families with children in the area.\n\nHave a wonderful family walk!\n -------------------------\nOkay, let's brainstorm some comforting and appealing road/street names that would be pleasant for a family walk near Dübendorf, Zurich. I'll focus on names that evoke:\n\n*   **Nature & Peacefulness:**  This aligns well with the Swiss environment.\n*   **Home & Warmth:** Names that feel safe and secure.\n*   **Simplicity & Clarity:** Easy to pronounce and understand, especially for children.\n\nHere are some ideas, with justifications:\n\n**Inspired by Nature (Most Common & Fitting):**\n\n*   **Blumenweg** (Flower Way): Always a classic. Who doesn't love flowers? Evokes a sense of beauty and care.\n*   **Waldstrasse** (Forest Street):  Hints at peaceful nearby woods. A reassuring connection to nature.\n*   **Bachweg** (Stream Way): Suggests the soothing sound of flowing water nearby.\n*   **Amselweg** (Blackbird Way) / **Vogelweg** (Bird Way): Friendly connection to birdsong and nature\n*   **Sonnenweg** (Sun Way) - suggests sunlight and happiness\n*   **Kirschblütenweg** (Cherry Blossom Way) - delicate and charming\n\n**Evoking Warmth & Security:**\n\n*   **Familienweg** (Family Way): Very direct and inviting.

A \"Waldstrasse\" should ideally be close to a forest or wood.\n*   **Pronunciation:**  Easy for non-German speakers to manage.\n*   **Association:** Are there any negative connotations to the name (historically or otherwise) that might make it less desirable?\n*   **Local Custom:** Consider names that are common or traditionally used in the region. It makes it sounds as \"Local is Beautiful\"\n\nI hope this list is a good starting point!  Let me know if you'd like more options or variations on any of these themes. If you tell me more context I can further tailor them. For example, a newly constructed neighborhood could allow for slightly more imaginative names, whereas a more established area might benefit from something more traditional. Good luck with your search!\n -------------------------\nOkay, here are some suggestions for nice road and street names that would be pleasant and comforting to encounter while walking as a family near Dübendorf, Zurich, with a focus on atmosphere and positive connotations. I'll try to blend traditional Swiss elements with generally appealing names:\n\n**General Niceness & Nature:**\n\n*   **Sonnenweg:** (Sun Way/Path) - A classic, evokes warmth and happiness.\n*   **Blumenweg:** (Flower Way/Path) - Cheerful and bright, perfect for a stroll.\n*   **Gartenstrasse:** (Garden Street) - Suggests peaceful surroundings.\n*   **Waldrandweg:** (Forest Edge Path) - For a walk along the forest.\n*   **Amselweg:** (Blackbird Way/Path) - Nature and songbird themed.\n*   **Kirschblütenweg:** (Cherry Blossom Way) - Beautiful and evocative, especially in spring.\n\n**Traditional & Charm:**\n\n*   **Dorfstrasse:** (Village Street) - A common and comforting name suggesting community.\n*   **Brunnenweg:** (Fountain Way/Path) - Swiss villages often have lovely fountains.\n*   **Rebbergstrasse:** (Vineyard Street) - Speaks to the area's natural beauty (assuming vineyards are nearby).\n*   **Alte Landstrasse:** (Old Country Road) - Nostalgic and suggests a slower pace of life.\n\n**Peaceful & Quiet:**\n\n*   **Ruheweg:** (Quiet Way/Path) - Self-explanatory and desirable.\n*   **Seestrasse:** (Lake Street) - Could be particularly nice if you can find any area which leads you to a small lake/pond.\n\n**Considerations for Dübendorf & its surroundings:**\n\n*   **Swiss German Dialect:** Street names are often in Swiss German dialect, so the above translations may have slight variations in their actual forms (e.g., \"Weg\" might be \"Wäg\").\n*   **Location near Glatt:** Any road leading up/towards Glatt might have a more modern street name.\n*   **Older Neighbourhoods:** Focus on the older parts of Dübendorf or the adjacent smaller villages (e.g., Wangen-Brüttisellen) to find more traditional names.\n\n**Where to Look on a Map:**\n\nTo maximize the chances of finding nice names, explore on a map around the edges of Dübendorf, particularly where it borders green spaces, parks, smaller residential areas, or nearby villages. Look in residential streets far away from the Airport. Zoom into areas to read the street names.\nAlso look for parks such as Zentrum Glatt which leads to more of an upbeat route\n\nI hope this gives you a good starting point for your family walks!  Enjoy exploring!\n -------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":64},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now try the same prompt with temperature set to zero.

Her days consisted of sunbathing on velvet cushions, delicately batting at dust motes, and judging the culinary choices of her human, Eleanor, with a discerning sniff. Adventure was messy, uncouth, and, frankly, beneath her.\n\nUntil the window was left ajar.\n\nA symphony of scents – damp earth, blooming honeysuckle, and something tantalizingly fishy – drifted in, a siren song to a primal instinct Clementine usually kept well-buried. Curiosity, that pesky feline flaw, pricked at her. She stretched, yawned dramatically (just in case Eleanor was watching), and nonchalantly hopped onto the windowsill. One tentative paw, then another, and Clementine was outside.\n\nThe world exploded in a kaleidoscope of green and brown. Grass tickled her paws, butterflies flitted like living confetti, and a chorus of birds chirped a welcome she hadn't anticipated. Initially, Clementine remained close to the house, carefully navigating the meticulously manicured flowerbeds. She stalked a particularly plump bumblebee, failing spectacularly, and discovered the profound joy of burying her nose in a patch of lavender.\n\nThen, she saw it: the garden fence, and beyond it, a tangled wilderness of overgrown hedges and whispering trees.\n\nHesitation flickered, but the lure of the unknown was too strong. With a graceful leap, she landed on the other side.\n\nThis was a different world altogether. The air was thick with the scent of damp leaves and decaying wood. Sunlight filtered through the dense canopy, painting dappled patterns on the forest floor. Clementine, emboldened by her initial success, became an explorer. She chased butterflies with reckless abandon, scaled a gnarled oak tree with surprising agility, and even had a standoff with a grumpy squirrel (which she, of course, won with a well-timed hiss).\n\nShe discovered a hidden stream, its water cool and refreshing against her tongue. She followed the stream further, deeper into the woods, until she reached a clearing bathed in golden light. In the center stood an ancient willow tree, its branches cascading like a verdant waterfall.\n\nBeneath the willow, she saw them.\n\nA colony of field mice, small and brown and utterly oblivious to her presence, were having a picnic. They were nibbling on berries, chattering amongst themselves, and generally having a grand time. Clementine's hunting instincts roared to life. She crouched low, her tail twitching, preparing to pounce.\n\nBut then, she paused.\n\nShe watched them, these tiny, vulnerable creatures, and a strange feeling washed over her. It wasn't hunger, or even the thrill of the hunt. It was…peace. She was a part of this wild world, a guardian, not just a predator.\n\nClementine straightened, shook her head, and let out a soft meow. The mice scattered, disappearing into the undergrowth. She licked her paw, washing the scent of the hunt away.\n\nThe sun was beginning to dip below the horizon when Clementine finally turned back towards home. The adventure had changed her. The world felt bigger, richer, and more vibrant than she ever imagined.\n\nEleanor was frantic with worry, pacing by the now-closed window. When she saw Clementine emerge from the bushes, her face lit up with relief. She scooped the cat into her arms, showering her with kisses.\n\nClementine purred, nestling into Eleanor’s embrace. She was glad to be home, but a part of her remained in that wild, untamed place. She knew, with a certainty that warmed her amber eyes, that this wouldn't be her last adventure. After all, a cat of her caliber couldn't be confined to velvet cushions forever. The world was waiting.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":66},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

You can define your own colors and symbols to represent the different Git states.\n*   **Asynchronous Operations:** It tries to perform some Git operations (like fetching remote information) asynchronously to avoid blocking the prompt and keep the terminal responsive.\n*   **Virtual Environment Support:** It can detect and display the name of the active Python virtual environment (or `node_virtualenv` or `conda`).\n*   **Configuration:** Uses `.bash-git-rc` to enable users to configure their prompt\n*   **Cross-Shell Compatibility:** Aims to work with both Bash and Zsh shells.\n\n**Why you would use it:**\n\n*   **Improved Workflow:** Quickly see the status of your Git repository directly in your prompt, making it easier to track changes and avoid mistakes.\n*   **Visual Cues:** The use of colors and symbols provides instant visual cues about the state of your repository.\n*   **Customization:** Tailor the prompt to your personal preferences and workflow.\n*   **Stay Informed:** Quickly identify if you have uncommitted changes, are behind the remote branch, or have merge conflicts.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":81},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nBe sure to check out the codelabs on day 3 too, where you will explore some more advanced prompting with code execution.\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!\n\n*- [Mark McD](https://linktr.ee/markmcd)*","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
